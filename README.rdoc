This is an app that lets you follow your representatives and will populate a news feed based on what the reps you're following have said in the Congressional Record.

It is powered by the congress gem (http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/congress/0.3.0) as well as the Capitol Words API (http://capitolwords.org/api/1/).

Future features for this include pulling in other actions your representatives have taken from other media sources as well as populating the news feed based on interest in specific topics (ie. 'gun control','heatlhcare', etc.) or follow all politicians who have received donations from companies.

The app is still in a very rudimentary stage, has ways to go and needs a better name.
